# Dynamo Model Express

Model Express is a Rust-based model cache management service designed to be deployed as a sidecar alongside existing inference solutions such as NVIDIA Dynamo. Model Express accelerates overall inference performance by reducing the latency of artifact downloads and writes.

## Project Overview

It should be established that although Model Express is a component of the Dyanmo inference stack, Model Express can be deployed standalone to accelerate other inference solutions such as vLLM, Sglang, etc. independent of Dynamo.

The current version of Model Express acts as a cache for HuggingFace, providing fast access to pre-trained models and reducing the need for repeated downloads across multiple servers. Additionally, this service aids fault tolerance for inference solutions by providing managed model persistence, ensuring that models remain available even in the event of node failures or restarts.

Model Express also shines in multi-node / multi-worker environments, where inference solutions may spawn multiple replicas that require model artifacts to be shared efficiently.

Future versions will expand support to additional model providers (AWS, Azure, NFS, etc.) and include features like model versioning, advanced caching strategies, advanced networking using [NIXL](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl), checkpoint storage, as well as a peer-to-peer model sharing system.

## Architecture

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with the following components:

- **`modelexpress_server`**: The main gRPC server that provides model services
- **`modelexpress_client`**: Client library for interacting with the server
- **`modelexpress_common`**: Shared code and constants between client and server

The current diagram represents a high-level overview of the Model Express architecture. It will evolve with time as we add new features and components.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group MXS(cloud)[Model Express]

    service db(database)[Database] in MXS
    service disk(disk)[Persistent Volume Storage] in MXS
    service server(server)[Server] in MXS

    db:L -- R:server
    disk:T -- B:server

    group MXC(cloud)[Inference Server]

    service client(server)[Client] in MXC
    disk:T -- B:client
```

The client is either a library embedded in the inference server of your choice, or a CLI tool which can be used beforehand to hydrate the model cache.

### CLI Tool

The client library includes a command-line interface, meant to facilitate interaction with the Model Express server, and act as a HuggingFace CLI replacement. In the future, it will also abstract other model providers, making it a one-stop shop for interacting with various model APIs.

See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) for detailed CLI documentation.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Latest stable version (recommended: 1.88)
- **Cargo**: Rust's package manager (included with Rust)
- **protoc**: The Protocol Buffers compiler is expected to be installed and usable
- **Docker** (optional): For containerized deployment

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd modelexpress
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
cargo build
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
cargo run --bin modelexpress-server
```

The server will start on `0.0.0.0:8001` by default.

## Running Options

### Option 1: Local Development

```bash
# Start the gRPC server
cargo run --bin modelexpress-server

# In another terminal, run tests
cargo test

# Run integration tests
./run_integration_tests.sh
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t model-express .
docker run -p 8000:8000 model-express
```

### Option 3: Kubernetes Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: With GPU support and `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- **HuggingFace Token**: Required for accessing HuggingFace models within your cluster via k8s secret as shown here:
  ```bash
  export HF_TOKEN=your_hf_token
  kubectl create secret generic hf-token-secret \
    --from-literal=HF_TOKEN=${HF_TOKEN} \
    -n ${NAMESPACE}
  ```
- **Docker Registry**: Container registry accessible from your cluster (Docker Hub, private registry, or local registry)
- **Model Express Image**: Built and pushed to your registry by building from root directory of repository
  ```bash
  # Build the Model Express image
  docker build -t model-express:latest .
  
  # Tag for your registry
  docker tag model-express:latest your-registry/model-express:latest
  
  # Push to your registry
  docker push your-registry/model-express:latest
  ```
- **Update Image Reference**: Update the image reference in your deployment files to match your registry
  ```yaml
  # In k8s-deployment.yaml or agg.yaml, update:
  image: your-registry/model-express:latest
  ```


Now to deploy Modelexpress in your cluster you can run:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
```

Please follow the guide [here](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/modelexpress/tree/main/examples/aggregated_k8s) to learn more on how to launch modelexpress with dynamo on kubernetes.

## Configuration

ModelExpress uses a layered configuration system that supports multiple sources in order of precedence:

1. **Command line arguments** (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables**
3. **Configuration files** (YAML)
4. **Default values** (lowest priority)

### Configuration File

Create a configuration file (supports YAML):

```bash
# Generate a sample configuration file
cargo run --bin config_gen -- --output model-express.yaml
```

Start the server with a configuration file:

```bash
cargo run --bin modelexpress-server -- --config model-express.yaml
```

#### Example Configuration Files

**Basic Configuration (`model-express.yaml`):**

```yaml
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0

```

**Running Commands:**
```bash
cargo run --bin modelexpress-server -- --config model-express.yaml
