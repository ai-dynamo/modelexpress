# Running Model Express with Dynamo on k8s

## 0. Prerequisites 

- [Install Dynamo Cloud on your Cluster](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/a8cb6554779f8283edd0c62d50743f2cb58e989b/docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/quickstart.md)

Should have respective pods running as shown here:

```
$ kubectl get po
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
dynamo-platform-dynamo-operator-controller-manager-54d48f4vdkh8   2/2     Running   6 (18h ago)   2d4h
dynamo-platform-etcd-0                                            1/1     Running   3 (18h ago)   2d4h
dynamo-platform-nats-0                                            2/2     Running   6 (18h ago)   2d4h
dynamo-platform-nats-box-5dbf45c748-vstcm                         1/1     Running   3 (18h ago)   2d4h
```


## 1. Use Model Express to Download a Model 

This section describes modelexpress workflow on a single node with both client and server. 

Ensure that the file structure here can be accessible for a volume we will mount into the cluster in a later step.

[Follow primary README.md for guidance on starting ModelExpress](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/modelexpress/blob/main/README.md)

#### Ensure Repository is cloned
```
$ git clone <repository-url>
$ cd ModelExpress
```

#### Build the project
```
$ cargo build
```

#### Start ModelExpress (will start on 0.0.0.0:8001 by default). 
```
$ cargo run --bin model_express_server

2025-08-01T22:22:50.568827Z  INFO model_express_server: Starting model_express_server with gRPC...
2025-08-01T22:22:50.568850Z  INFO model_express_server: Listening on gRPC endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8001
```

Open a seperate shell to use the CLI

#### Build Model Express CLI
```
$ cargo build --bin model-express-cli
```

Configure ModelExpress (can skip if using defaults)
```
$ ./target/release/model-express-cli model init

Enter your local cache mount path [~/.model-express/cache]: 
Enter your server endpoint [http://localhost:8001]: 
Auto-mount cache on startup? [Y/n]: 
Save this configuration? [Y/n]: 
ModelExpress Storage Configuration
===================================
Configuration saved successfully!
Storage path: "/home/kavink/.model-express/cache"
Server endpoint: http://localhost:8001
Auto-mount: true
```

#### Download a model using the CLI (should see more info on server log)
```
$ ./target/release/model-express-cli model download --endpoint http://localhost:8001 model download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B

Model Download
  Model: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
  Provider: HuggingFace
  Strategy: SmartFallback


âœ… SUCCESS
  Model 'Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B' downloaded successfully
```

### List the contents of Qwen in the Cache (for later step)
```
$ ls -al ~/.model-express/cache/models--Qwen--Qwen3-0.6B/snapshots/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 kavink domain-users 4096 Aug  1 15:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 kavink domain-users 4096 Aug  1 15:27 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 kavink domain-users 4096 Aug  1 15:27 c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca
```

Remember the hash path `/models--Qwen--Qwen3-0.6B/snapshots/c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca` for a later step when we start Dynamo

## 2. Create a K8s Persistent Volume and Claim for our Cache

Create a .yaml file with the following contents (eg. dynamo-models-volume.yaml)

Ensure spec.local.path has the path to your ModelExpress cache
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: model-express-cache-pv
  labels:
    type: local-storage
    app: model-express
spec:
  storageClassName: local-storage
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi  # Adjust based on your model cache size requirements
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  local:
    path: /home/kavink/.model-express/cache
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - your-node-name  # Replace with your actual node name
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: model-express-cache-pvc
  namespace: default  # Adjust namespace as needed
spec:
  storageClassName: local-storage
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi  # Should match the PV capacity
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: local-storage
      app: model-express 
```

Apply the .yaml config:
```
$ kubectl apply -f dynamo-models-volume.yaml
```

## 3. Deploy Dynamo on K8s with the Cache

Clone [Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo):
```
$ git clone <repository-url>
$ cd dynamo
```

Open `./dynamo/components/backends/vllm/deploy/agg.yaml` and use the PVC to mount the cache to `/model` to both dynamo workers / services `Frontend` and `VllmDecodeWorker`:
```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: DynamoGraphDeployment
metadata:
  name: vllm-agg
spec:
  services:
    Frontend:
      <..Other Contents Remain the Same..>
      pvc:
        name: model-express-cache-pvc
        mountPoint: /model
    VllmDecodeWorker:
      <..Other Contents Remain the Same..>
      pvc:
        name: model-express-cache-pvc
        mountPoint: /model
```

Additionally, we must specify the right path to the model hash snapshot (from above) relative to the `/model` \
```
VllmDecodeWorker:
    <..Other Contents Remain the Same..> 
          args:
            - "python3 -m dynamo.vllm --model /model/models--Qwen--Qwen3-0.6B/snapshots/c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca | tee /tmp/vllm.log"
    <..Other Contents Remain the Same..>
```

Lastly you will need to accquire an [access token from Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens), and will need to create a kubernetes secret:
```
kubectl create secret generic hf-token-secret --from-literal=HF_TOKEN=$HF_TOKEN
```

Now we can create the dynamo deployment:
```
kubectl apply -f ./dynamo/components/backends/vllm/deploy/agg.yaml

dynamographdeployment.nvidia.com/vllm-agg created
```

Should see two new pods, that will eventually load:
```
$ kubectl get po
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
dynamo-platform-dynamo-operator-controller-manager-54d48f4vdkh8   2/2     Running   6 (19h ago)   2d4h
dynamo-platform-etcd-0                                            1/1     Running   3 (19h ago)   2d4h
dynamo-platform-nats-0                                            2/2     Running   6 (19h ago)   2d4h
dynamo-platform-nats-box-5dbf45c748-vstcm                         1/1     Running   3 (19h ago)   2d4h
vllm-agg-frontend-fb896dffc-pnrfl                                 1/1     Running   0             38s
vllm-agg-vllmdecodeworker-67986d65b-7sx9j                         1/1     Running   0             38s
```


If you look at the logs of the decode worker, you can see we bypass downloading the model
```
$ kubectl logs vllm-agg-vllmdecodeworker-67986d65b-7sx9j 
```

Now lets make an inference request, by first port-forwarding the front end to our local 8000 port:
```
$ kubectl port-forward pods/vllm-agg-frontend-fb896dffc-pnrfl 8000:8000

Forwarding from [::1]:8000 -> 8000
```

Lets send the request now:
```
$ curl -s -N --no-buffer -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'accept: text/event-stream' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B","messages": [{"role": "user","content": "In the heart of Eldoria, an ancient land of boundless magic and mysterious creatures, lies the long-forgotten city of Aeloria.

```

We have just demonstrated running dynamo with a cache managed by the ModelExpress
